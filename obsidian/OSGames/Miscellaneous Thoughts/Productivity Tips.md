# Overview

## low mental, low thought working tips
- Play a tv show in the background, the slower the tv show the better. This tip works best when you're doing repetitive tasks that don't require much though.
- Play some energizing music in the background 

## high though, high mental working tips
- plan and brainstorm things offline, away from the computer. This is discussed more in [[Domain-Based Working]]
- break down the task into sub tasks as much as possible
- Remind yourself that progress is incremental
- Spend time explaining and documenting your thoughts - even if the notes are trash. This provides an accountability system and tests your understanding of the idea.
