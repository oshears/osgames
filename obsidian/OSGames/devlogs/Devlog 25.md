# Gaming In VR/AR/MR/XR

## Abstract

Gaming has become quite an oversaturated market. While there are new and revolutionary ideas that come out every few months or so, I believe that progress and innovation have slowed quite a bit. The Nintendo Wii took a strong grasp of the market when it was first released by brining in innovative new gameplay controls (i.e., the Wii Remote and Motion Plus) in an approachable way that lowered the barrier to entry for gaming and allowed more non-traditional gamers to get involved. The Switch somewhat iterated on this by focusing on making a singular portable console system accessible and playable to several players while on the go. Furthermore, the addition of gyroscopic controls further enhanced the way that players could engage with their games and opened the door for new ideas or further improving the intuitiveness of existing games (e.g. first person shoots and Splatoon).

## Thesis

**Thesis**: Game developers should spend more time developing VR/AR/MR/XR type games, to find more critical success and lead to better innovation and technological breakthroughs for gaming and interactive experiences. The challenges limiting development in this field must be overcome individual in the short term, and time should be sacrificed investing into this technology.

## Challenges
- VR Headsets are *cost prohibitive*, but this is changing thanks to an ever increasing influx of consumer accessible devices, such as the **Meta Quest 3**.
- VR is *harder to develop for*, but this is improving thanks to increasing online resources and the assistance of LLMs like Claude AI.
