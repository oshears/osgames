# Overview
This week I've gone through quite a big shift in my motivation. Up until last week I was highly motivated to implement Nemesis as a computer game. I thought this would be a really cool idea and provide a level of accessibility for people who couldn't play the game. In addition to this, I could bring the game to people who are on the go with a switch or steam deck and wanted to play with others.

Unfortunately though, I felt a big motivation drop after playing this game in person with my friends. The game was fun and complex to play with friends, but that in person experience made me realize that the game might work better as an in person board game instead of a video game. Of course the benefits I listed earlier may still be applicable, but I don't think they would be better than the board game experience of playing Nemesis. All this being said, I've felt a little unmotivated regarding finishing this game because I feel I wouldn't be able to achieve the same magic that Nemesis brings as an in person board game. More thoughts on why I believe it works better as a board game below:

# Why Nemesis Works Better as a Board Game

## 1. The game is complex
As a beginning, making an AI that can play Nemesis like a human seems to be quite difficult. This is partially due to the amount of coordination required between players.

## 2. The game can be slow
It definitely lends itself to a table top style format where players can gather physically as opposed to in a video game. At the very least it works best as a multiplayer board game, as opposed to a single player computer game. Even if AIs were included, I think the game still might be a bit uninteresting once you've played it once.

# What's next?

 In an effort to resolve these feels of lacking motivation, I have shifted my focus to making a smaller game that uses elements of Nemesis that I wanted to explore (e.g. Cassette Futurism aesthetic and sounds, space exploration story, alien threats). Initially my goal was to make this game in unreal engine, so I did a bit of a deep dive into it to try and learn more about the engine this past week.

While unreal is a pretty powerful engine, I found myself a bit overwhelmed by all of its features. Of course I was overwhelmed by Unity initially too, but it seems like Unreal is quite complex and would be hard to just build a quick simple game.

# Unreal Engine

## Pros
- Very quick build time and no need for domain reloading and recompiling of C# assemblies all the time
- Very nice graphics.
- Blueprints are cool and make sense. The offer a nice abstraction when composing the level.
## Cons
- it seemed complicated to setup a simple animation state machine. This was the major thing that demotivated me.
- It seems like setting up the UI GUI takes a bit of work.
- It wasn't immediately clear how to add controller support.
- It crashed when I did something in a blueprint that caused a null reference exception.

# Next Project: Anomaly

My idea for my next game, Anomaly. Is a simple space station tower defense concept. I am inspired by games like Cataclismo, Bad North, and Thronefall. I would like the game to feature simple graphics, cassette futurism elements and aesthetics (sounds, terminal graphics), and be nice and simple.

My goal for this week is to hopefully get a simple playable demo going where you can view the aesthetic and walk between the corridors of the space station.
