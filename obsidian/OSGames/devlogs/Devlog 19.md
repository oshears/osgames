## The Godfather

I watched **The Godfather** for the first time this week. While it wasn't my favorite movie, it am glad to finally understand the origin of so many cultural references! *Spoiler alert*: I was quite supposed that the godfather died in the godfather ðŸ˜®

## Kingdom Come Deliverance

I have also been playing **Kingdom Come Deliverance**. It is an interesting rpg in the sense that it is hardcore and has a focus on realism. For the most part I have been enjoying it quite a bit, and playing it on my steam deck just makes it even better to quickly hop in and out of the game!


## Surviving the Ice Storm

Rest in power to all the trees that lost limbs in my neighborhood due to the ice storm. I've never really experienced the damage that I've can wreck on trees until this week.

## National Park Puzzle

Gia and I finished this cool National park puzzle in about 5-7 hours. It was quite fulfilling to have completed the whole thing is such a relatively short amount of time. (It was 1,000 pieces!)
