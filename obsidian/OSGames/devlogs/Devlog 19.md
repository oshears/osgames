# Lonnies Fishtank

This week I've added the following features to **Lonnie's Fishtank**:
- Tank decorating 
- Achievements 
- Basic fish interactions
Check them out in the devlog below, or read more about it here: 

## The Godfather

I watched **The Godfather** for the first time this week. While it wasn't my favorite movie, it am glad to finally understand the origin of so many cultural references! *Spoiler alert*: I was quite supposed that the godfather died in the godfather ðŸ˜®

## Kingdom Come Deliverance

I have also been playing **Kingdom Come Deliverance**. It is an interesting rpg in the sense that it is hardcore and has a focus on realism. For the most part I have been enjoying it quite a bit, and playing it on my steam deck just makes it even better to quickly hop in and out of the game!
