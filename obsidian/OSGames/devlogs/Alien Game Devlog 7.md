Recently I have been losing a little bit of my drive when it comes to game development. While I feel very capable of learning new things and using my newfound knowledge to create any game I can think of, I have recently been feeling a bit unmotivated and uninspired when it comes to making a new game.

It was nice during the golden age of **Triple Calavera** because we had a strong accountability system between all of our team members and were working towards a common goal. While I might not have enjoyed the actual games that we ended up producing very much, it was easy to ignore the bigger questions that were being suppressed in my head. Questions like *"What is the purpose of this game?"* or *"Does the world need this game?"*, or even *"Is this the best use of my time? Could I be doing something more meaningful in the world?"*

Playing the game **[Webfishing]([WEBFISHING on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/)** recently made me ponder on these questions even more. How could such a simple game provide so much satisfaction to so many people around the world. Does the world need more of these types of games? Is there a purpose or a point for me to make another game like Webfishing, when it already exists and is filling that void aduquately already?

While money isn't my main motivator when it comes to game dev, it has been baffling to see the amount that Webfishing generated. In total, the creator made [half a million dollars](https://steam-revenue-calculator.com/app/3146520/WEBFISHING/) over the course of just a few weeks. It really just goes to show the demand of this type of game right now, especially games that people can play with their friends. This is even more prevelant in these trying times and the state of the world right now.
