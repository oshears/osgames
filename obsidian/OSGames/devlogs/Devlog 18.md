# Lonnies Fishtank

This week I iterated on the following areas for [[Lonnies Fishtank]]:
- **Walking Overhauls:** I tied together quite a bit of the logic for the walking scene. Now players can plan out the route and execute the route, along with passing encounter points along the way. Currently encounter points just present some message for the player to read, as well as an optional fish to represent the neighbor's fish. In the future, these encounters will add things like fish, money, items, and other things for the player to collect.
- **Room Presentation Updates:** I've also added in several third party assets from Synty. Now the rooms looks much better and the fish tank very nicely fits into the scenes.

# Dice of Los Suenos

I also had the chance to play a couple of indie games on Itch. This was inspired after having such a great time playing [Shroom and Gloom](https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom), which I praised and talked about in my last devlog ([[Devlog 17#Shroom and Gloom]]).

The first game I played this week, was [The Dice of Los Suenos](https://zittacheng.itch.io/dice-of-los-suenos). This was a cool small roguelike game where you roll 3 6-sided die and assign them to relevant cards to try and keep your kingdom balanced. It's very much like the game [Reigns](https://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/Reigns/) which I enjoyed the concept of. This game has more interesting gameplay than Reigns because you are more in control of your decisions and you can directly see the outcome of performing certain actions. Things are always more interesting when you have more control and when numbers are involved.

# Twilight Tower

I also played a game called [Twilight Tower](https://boz-float.itch.io/twilight-tower). While I didn't like it as much, it still was an interesting game with a lot of cool decision making, which is a feature in games that I have really been enjoying a lot recently!
