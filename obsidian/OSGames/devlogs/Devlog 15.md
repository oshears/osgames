## Skeleton Hell 2

The **Triple Calavera** team has also been discussing what we'd like to see in a Skeleton Hell 2 game. In general there are two major changes proposed: using a sonic engine as the basis of the game mechanics and 
### Sonic Engine Mechanics

Evan proposed shifting to a 3rd person perspective and using mechanics inspired by precoded sonic engines. The concept is that sonic games have a lot of features that we were interested in bringing into Skeleton Hell. In our adaptation of the engine, we can view the rings as bones, Sonic's rolling state as the skull rolling state, and many other parallels.

### User Generated Levels

One thing I observed from previous community engage with Skeleton Hell was (1) the speed running culture that emerged from it, and (2) the completionism culture that emerged from it. Speed runners competed to see who could find their heart and escape the dungeon the fastest, while completionist sought to earn every achievement that was added to the game. I believe that these two mentalities towards playing the game can be supported even more by the introduction of user generated levels. 

One of the major issues I had with Skeleton Hell was a lack of content. Although we had some slight procedural generation in the game, it was very much underutilized and many of the runs / dungeons often looked the same. To improve upon this, I propose adding user generated levels to the game.

Upon opening a level editor found within the game, users can create and customize their own Skeleton Hell levels, much in the same vein as *Mario Maker*. Players can edit the level in a 3D space. Players would then have to prove that the level could be beaten before it would show up in the level browser. 

As far as the community goes, players would have the ability to vote on their favorite levels and reward those players with reputation based on who designed the best levels. This in game rewarding could even translate to some in game bonuses or cosmetics to incentivize people to make the best levels and keep them coming back to the game. Really I think there's a lot of potential that can be explored with this idea.

This idea is unique because it'd be the first co-op survival horror game with built in user generated content and level editing capabilities. To my knowledge, no other game has attempted to do this. I believe that this ideas is even strong when you add the unique bone mechanics and multiplayer gameplay that Skeleton Hell introduced.
