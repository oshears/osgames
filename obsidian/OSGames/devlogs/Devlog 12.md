## Lonnies Fishtank

In this brief video, I overview some of the gameplay that I've been working to implement over the past few weeks.

## Mork Borg

This week I also read over the Mork Borg Campaign Rotblack Sludge in detail and am excited to run it at some point!

## Mothership

I also did some prep to get ready to run Moon Base Blues for Zion and Gia this week hopefully!

## Other RPGs

I've been interested in the aesthetics and themes of this RPG called **Root**! I definitely want to try picking it up and learning more about it.

## Great Smoky Mountains!

I also took a cool trip to the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee this past week! It was an exhausting 12 mile, 4K ft elevation hike, but an exciting and novel adventure at the same time!
