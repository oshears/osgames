# Shroom and Gloom

I haven't been playing many games lately, but I decided to finally check out this interesting looking "rougelike deckbuilder" on itch. The artstyle really caught my eye a few months ago and I've been waiting to make time to try it ever since. Man was it worth the wait! I highly recommend it! Especially because it's free! Not having played any other deckbuilder type games, this was definitely a great introduction to the genre; Though I know Balatro is the popular choice ðŸ˜†
