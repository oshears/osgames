## Lonnies Fishtank

This week I worked on adding customization functionality for the fish. I laid the foundation for changing the fish body types as well as their colors. This upcoming week I will continue to add new customization features for the fins, tail and eyes of the fish.

I also plan to add the option to get new customization options from the tech spin machine at some point by spending currency to perform a roll. Ideally the items collected by the player should be stored in their save data, and the gachapon should not give them anything they've already obtained. 

Once this is implemented, I can move on to refining the UI a bit more and adding more abilities to interact with the fish.
## Backpacking

I also went backpacking at Mount Roger's this past weekend! While it was incredibly cold, I enjoyed seeing the snow covered landscape and trekking through several feet of snow!
