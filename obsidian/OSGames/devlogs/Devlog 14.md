## Lonnies Fishtank

This week I worked on adding customization functionality for the fish. I laid the foundation for changing the fish body types as well as their colors. This upcoming week I will continue to add new customization features for the fins, tail and eyes of the fish.

I also plan to add the option to get new customization options from the tech spin machine at some point by spending currency to perform a roll. Ideally the items collected by the player should be stored in their save data, and the gachapon should not give them anything they've already obtained. 

Once this is implemented, I can move on to refining the UI a bit more and adding more abilities to interact with the fish.

## Backpacking at Mount Rogers

I also went backpacking at Mount Roger's this past weekend! While it was incredibly cold, I enjoyed seeing the snow covered landscape and trekking through several feet of snow! Jason, Huy and I all struggled quite a bit with this hike, but still had a good time overall. I am looking forward to revisiting Mount Rogers in the future and hopefully spotting some wild horses next time!

## The Penguin

This week I also finished watching the penguin with Gia. It was a great show, and while I feel disgusted with many of the characters after finishing it, it was quite an entertaining ride! Good writing and great performances all around! 8.5/10!


## Root Board Game

I have also been enjoying learning more about how to play the root board game with Gia (starting with the steam version). It is definitely one of the most interesting board games I've played both aesthetically and mechanically. I love the concept of this asymmetrical war game and am looking forward to exploring more of the root universe through the Root RPG and by learning about all the new and various factions.
