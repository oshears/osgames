## Lonnies Fishtank

This week I officially started development on Lonnies Fishtank! A Nintendogs inspired cozy game being developed under the team at Fish Head Games. I did various prep for starting development of the game including:
1. Similar game research and marketability / potential
2. UI Design and exploration using Vaporwave and Y20K inspired artstyles
3. Setting up the GitHub repos and organization

In order to improve the maintainability and scalability of the game, I want to adopt practices that I attempted in my previous project, Primoridal. The key concepts I would like to apply include:
1. The command pattern
2. Behavior Trees
3. Having a complete game flow as early as possible
