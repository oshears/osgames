basic fish interactions to the game


### Reframing the Game as a Cozy Roguelike
- how you spend your day matters
- similar to stardew in this way
- also like citizen sleeper
- loosely like kingdom come deliverence
- if animal cross had limited time during the day and how you spent it mattered
- option to turn this setting off for hyper casual gamers

It would be really interesting to frame this game as pokemon / creature collector game, but where your time matter and every second you spend doing / training one fish, that's time that you're not spending training the others.

This seems like a really interesting mechanic for many games to adopt. Instead of just focusing on grinding all of your characters, you are either rewarded or punished for grinding certain characters and neglecting the others.
