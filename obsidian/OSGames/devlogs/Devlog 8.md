description: New opportunities and potential partnerships!
---
This week I established contact with another potential game dev partner. He is a music composes and is interested in creating a Nintendogs like game but with fish.

I really like the aesthetic he is pitching and think this could be a cool opportunity if we successfully form the team!

Per my previous devlogs, I am finding that is is critical to establish a team for me in order to generate the motivation for devlog. Without the team, I find it very directionless and pointless making games that neither I or anyone else will play.

Initially it was nice to learn the tools, but now that I am relatively comfortable with them, I am finding it hard to continue the hobby.
