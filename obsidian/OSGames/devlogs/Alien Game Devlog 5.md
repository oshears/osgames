# Overview

This week I took a big detour and stepped into the world of web development. I was always curious about JavaScript and making websites, so this little aside has brought a lot of new understanding. I practiced making a new NextJS project (backed by Node and React), and learned about all of the cool components that can be added to a React web app (animations, graphs, UI libraries).

# Goal Oriented-Action Planning
I also conducted quite a bit of research into two AI approaches for games: *Minimax* and *Goal Oriented Action Planning*.

This interest was prompted by my recent work in to linear programming and constraints solving. It made me excited to work on optimization and AI behavior.
