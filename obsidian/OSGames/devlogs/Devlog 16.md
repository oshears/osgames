## Ashley's Fish Models

I added the fish variations using the 3D goldfish models that Ashely has been working on! Here are some demonstrations below:

## Tutorials

I also worked on creating some basic tutorials for the game. The goal is to make these tutorials so that I can allow the rest of the team to experiment with the build and test things out, without worrying about learning all the controls. I guess in the short term I could also just give them the controls as a text document / the text box on the screen.
