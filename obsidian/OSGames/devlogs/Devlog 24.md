# Dinner with Evan

I was able to hang out with my friend **Evan** while in LA! Evan was the team lead for our indie game, Skeleton Hell. It was awesome to meet him in person and catch up. I hope to return to LA in the future and sync up with him again!

# NRV Game Dev Interest Post

This week, after being inspired by meeting up with Evan in person, I finally posted an initial event to try and connect with local game developers in the NRV. My goal is really just to see if I can meet at least one person with similar interests in the area and establish a routine meetup with them. It would be very beneficial to have a work buddy and I am curious about the types of projects that other people are working on and what inspires them.

Simultaneously, I do want to try and further develop the partnerships that I currently have. While the momentum for **Triple Calavera** has passed with everyone being busy with new jobs and projects, I can still do my best to make the most out of the current momentum under **Fish Head Games**. This means being more present on the discord, asking my collaborators more questions outside of their progress / results, and generally sharing more information with the team.
